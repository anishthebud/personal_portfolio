# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio. This portfolio is a reflection of my full-stack web development skills, using a PERN stack with Supabase and TypeScript. The portfolio includes an About Me section, Experience section with education and projects, Skills section, Favorite Films section showcasing a display that shows me through my film taste, and resume and links to important websites (Github and LinkedIn). Here's the link to visit my portfolio: https://personal-portfolio-9kvz-76fmw94p0-anish-budidas-projects.vercel.app/.

## Use of Cursor

For this project, I experimented with using Cursor. I primarily used it to generate boilerplate code for my components such as the panels for each of the movies and the frame for my resume, as well as to help with styling my website. I found that it didn't do exactly what I wanted to most times, so I had to do a lot of debugging to figure out how to fix that code for my needs. So, I found that having an understanding of the fundamentals of web development and database design was vital in being able to complete this project.
